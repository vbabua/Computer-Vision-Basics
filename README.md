# Computer-Vision-Basics

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover foundational concepts and techniques in computer vision. Each notebook delves into a specific topic, offering detailed explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Contents

1. **Image Processing Basics (`1.ipynb`)**
    - Basic image manipulation
    - Pixel intensity transformations
    - Image thresholding

2. **Convolution and Filtering (`2.ipynb`)**
    - 2D convolution operation
    - Image filtering with various kernels
    - Edge detection using the Sobel operator

3. **Image Transformation (`3.ipynb`)**
    - Geometric transformations including rotation and scaling
    - Image warping

4. **Texture Classification using LBP (`4.ipynb`)**
    - Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for texture description
    - Image division into non-overlapping windows
    - Feature descriptor extraction and normalization
    - Image classification based on LBP histograms

5. **Video Processing and Object Detection (`5.ipynb`)**
    - Frame differencing for object detection in video sequences
    - Pixel-by-pixel frame differencing using reference frames
    - Background generation for video sequences
    - Moving object counting and visualization
